Fixed bug of assuming address under 32 bit. Triggered by vattay's OSX ASLR issue.

Tip for Windows gcc (MinGW) compiler user, you can use the Linux's equihash_avx2.o with this function prototype:
void __attribute__((sysv_abi)) EhPrepare(void *context, void *input);
int32_t __attribute__((sysv_abi)) EhSolver(void *context, uint32_t nonce);

Added AVX1 version.

Initial version, single threaded only. AVX2 required
Expected performance:
Core i5-4200U single thread 450ms, 4.4 Sol/s. Expect 1.8x performance when 2 instances are run.
